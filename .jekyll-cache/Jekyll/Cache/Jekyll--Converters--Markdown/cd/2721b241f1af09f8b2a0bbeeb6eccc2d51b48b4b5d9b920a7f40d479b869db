Since its beginnings in 1983, the University Galleries has been an innovator in South Floridaâ€™s contemporary visual arts, presenting exhibitions of local, national, and international art in new genres as well as traditional forms. The University Galleriesâ€™ activities also include lectures, panel discussions, poetry readings, film series, and music performances, providing alternate contexts for approaching art. Our award-winning arts education program ensures access to our activities for middle and high school age students. Admission to all University Galleries exhibitions and programs is free and open to the public.&lt;/td&gt;
