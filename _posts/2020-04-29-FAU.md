        <p> Welcome to the <i>2020 Juried Student Exhibition</i>, presented by the University Galleries and the Department of Visual Arts and Art History at Florida Atlantic   University each spring for over 25 years. Due to the unfortunate circumstances and unprecedented events around COVID-19, we are proud to recognize the work of this   year`s selected students through remote means. Congratulations to all who entered and those chosen by this year`s Juror, Sibel Kocabasi, South Florida artist and FAU     Masters of Fine Arts alumna whose work was recently featured in <i>Hand and I: Mending the World One Stitch at a Time exhibition</i> (Schmidt Center Gallery, November 8,   2019 – February 1, 2020).</p>
